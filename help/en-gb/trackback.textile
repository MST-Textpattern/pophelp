h1. Trackback

Many content management systems offer trackbacks to individual articles or postings. 

At their simplest, trackbacks offer a way to say, "I've said something about this article; here's the name of my site, a link to the mention, and a brief excerpt". The other site's owner can then use the trackback information however she wishes.

Some have likened trackbacks to 'referrers you insert manually', but that's a little reductive.
