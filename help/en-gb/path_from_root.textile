h1. Preferences: Root path to Textpattern

If your Textpattern site is located in a subdirectory away from your web server's root directory, enter that path here.

h3. Example

If the site is located at:

bc. http://www.mysite.com/testing/

Then you would set this value to:

bc. /testing/

If the site *is* located in the root directory, then set the value to a single forward slash:

bc. /
