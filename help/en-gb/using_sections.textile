h1. Using Sections

'Sections' in Textpattern are significant in that they don't merely imply a type to which articles belong. Each 'Section' has attached to it a layout (either created by you or generated by Textpattern), a 'Style' in the form of a CSS(Cascading Style Sheet) file, and a physical location on the webserver.

When posting new articles, all this information, which is pertinent to the future display of the article, is attached through the choice of 'Section'.

That said, the first 'Section' we should address is one that can't be attached to articles at all, called *default*.

For a simple website, a single 'Section' (called 'articles', for example) may be all that's required.
