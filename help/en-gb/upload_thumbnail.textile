h1. Images: Upload thumbnail

Full-size images can be assigned their own thumbnails. These are useful for linking to and indexing full-size images.

A reference to the thumbnail is exactly the same as the reference to the full-size image, with the addition of @t@ to the filename. For example, to reference a thumbnail associated with a fullsize image stored at @/images/12.jpg@ you would use @/images/12t.jpg@.
