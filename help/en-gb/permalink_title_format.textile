h1. Preferences: Permalink titles with hyphens or in CamelCase

This setting only has an effect when 'Attach titles to permalinks?' is set to 'Yes'. When generating 'article-titles' for use in URLs, you have the option of:

# Using all lowercase letters, and replacing spaces with hyphens
# Completely removing spaces, and using CamelCase, which means that the beginning of new words will be marked by uppercase letters
