h1. Preferences: Using Categories?

Attaching categories to articles adds a level of organisation and searchability to your site, however those publishing a simple site may find categorisation to be an unnecessary or unwanted step in the publishing of an article.

When set to 'No', category options will be removed from the article 'Write' tab, as well as from the navigation options above.
