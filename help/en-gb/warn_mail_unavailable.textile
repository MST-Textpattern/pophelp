h1. Diagnostics: Your PHP installation is missing the mail() function

On your host PHP is not compiled with a "(link-external)mail":http://php.net/manual/en/function.mail.php function. Therefore Textpattern cannot send emails, and you will not be able to use some functions. For example you won't be able to receive email notifications for comments, and you won't be able to add other users (well, you can add them, but they won't receive the email with their password).
