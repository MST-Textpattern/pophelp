h1. Importing into Textpattern

You can import your data into Textpattern CMS from the following publishing tools:

* Movable Type
* Blogger
* WordPress (including custom prefixes for your databases, if you're using them)
* b2

If you choose to import from a file - that is, MovableType or Blogger - you must place it under the @/include/import@ directory of your textpattern install directory, and call it @import.txt@.
