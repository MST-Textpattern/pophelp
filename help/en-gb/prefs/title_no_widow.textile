h1. Preferences: Prevent widowed words in article titles?

The term "widowed word" refers to the single final word of an article title that is shown on a new line when the article title is too long to fit on one line. In printed works, widows are considered sloppy typography and should be avoided. Setting this preference to 'Yes' will ensure that long article lines will never have only the last word on a separate line. Instead, the two last words will appear on a separate line.
