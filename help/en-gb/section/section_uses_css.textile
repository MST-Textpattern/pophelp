h1. Sections: Uses style

If you wish to override the 'default' stylesheet for a particular 'Section', this can be set here.

Obviosuly this is only relevant to stylesheets held within Textpattern 'Styles' - if you host your CSS externally of Textpattern (which is highly recommended), this options has no effect.
